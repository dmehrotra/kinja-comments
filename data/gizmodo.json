(or many others at the heart of events). surely a true investigation of events by any dedicated investigator would include interviewing a key protagonist at the epicentre of events? the peddling of the myth that julian assange sought to capitalise on seth rich\u2019s death by claiming he was the source is a deliberate smear campaign. repeated ad nauseam throughout varied hack jobs and mainstream media pieces such as this one. i think anyone reading this article should dive deeper on their own volition and find out the truth themselves rather than rely on hatchet \u2018journalism\u2019 pieces for clarity. for the record assange offered to comply with the swedish authorities on numerous occasions while he was located at the ecuadorian embassy in london. other efforts were made by his side to go as far as necessary to assist the swedish prosecutor in their inquiries. moreover, in the case of the current charge against assange the swedish authorities already closed the case once before, not only because of assange\u2019s being holed up at the embassy, but also due to lack of much more than flimsy evidence for their prosecution. the swedish prosecutor should well know that the charge at hand has very little chance of being successfully proven. then why go to the trouble of an international extradition with much fanfare? indeed why would the prosecutor feel the need even to have a public press conference to announce extradition procedures had been started? wouldn\u2019t a mere statement from their office have been enough? assange has always stated he will be happy to defend the charges laid against him. frankly, the original levelling of the sexual assault charges against julian assange from within sweden, at a pivotal point in the wikileaks story appears as incongruous as the death of seth rich does in the continuum of the rest of the wikileaks timeline. and i\u2019m not buying the currently much aired smear that to question the death of seth rich and to postulate at who may have been responsible for his death is some kind of \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 - at least not as the term conspiracy theory is currently used by the establishment to deride any and all types of just investigations of opaque dealings of the powerful - a man at the heart of the story died tragically. in the midst of it all. to date there has been no evidence offered as to whom may have been responsible. to use the old \u2018don\u2019t speak i\u2019ll of the dead\u2019 mantra as a way to obscure, deflect and accuse assange of further wrong doing is clearly a tactic from within

week.  my current \u201cquest\u201d is to take 80 rides in 4 days during the work week for an extra $140 bonus.  if i hit it, next week it will be 85 or 90.  this weekend it\u2019s 60 rides in 3 days.  that\u2019s 140 rides a week, which would mean being online and working roughly 70-84 hours a week.  that\u2019s more than is legally allowed under federal law for commercial drivers; cdl truckers are locked out of driving for 34 hours if they work more than 70 hours in any 8 day period, and are required to take 10 hour breaks for every 11 hours of active time.  uber lets you drive 12 hours with only 6 hour breaks between, and doesn\u2019t count time for your 12 hours that you\u2019re parked, so you could be online and working for 30 hours if 2/3 of your time is spent parked.  just because i\u2019ve figured out how to navigate the system and don\u2019t have a gambling problem with trying to wager my luck for a carrot on a stick, doesn\u2019t mean that their practices

worse, and nvidia stated that they do not forsee another uptick in cryptocurrency demand. considering they couldn\u2019t meet demand last year, and that hardware like this is planned years in advance, i highly doubt nvidia\u2019s business plan relied on cryptocurrency continuing to be a big thing (it did cause nvidia\u2019s stock to drop precipitously, but the reason why we haven\u2019t heard more about that is likely because nvidia expected it to some degree as did the market).\n\nall this being said, their high-end gpus have been about the same level of expensive for quite a while. the first (going back) general high end card to be priced under 699 at launch was the gtx 680, at $500 six years ago. the first where the highest end card (i.e., not aimed at the average high end consumer, essentially bridging the professional/consumer gpu gap) was priced under $1000 was the gtx 590, seven years ago (at $699), though arguably nvidia didn\u2019t begin aiming at the high end to professional gap until the 690. \n\nthe titan series, of course, is extremely expensive (with this one being an enormous jump) but nvidia is pretty forthcoming (though not entirely) about the titan not actually being aimed at playing video games really well. arguably they were experimenting with having another high end level with the titan, considering it was always more expensive than the highest end main series card. the ti series appears to have replaced the x90 series as the highest end mainline card, while the titan appears to have replaced the x90 series\u2019 purpose as a bridge between consumer and professional level gpus.\n\nthe 20 series does not seem to have entry level cards yet, but they either are relying on the 10 series for that, or are going to release the entry level cards next year. otherwise, their pricing at all levels has been pretty consistent for a while now, though they are advertising their highest end stuff more aggressively.\n"], "count": 1},

inconsistencies, we obviously can\u2019t get accurate numbers on suicides. the second shortcoming is that it is almost impossible to prove causation with statistics, merely correlation. \n\na good

is some sort of causation there... but they completely neglect that these rainier counties in oregon, washington, and california are also tech and aerospace hubs with a massive population influx of engineers, which studies have shown have a much higher likelihood of having children on the autism spectrum, while the sunnier counties are more agricultural economies. yet \u201cthe experts in the study\u201d were claiming all sorts of nonsense like it possibly being caused by pollution captured in the rain.\n\nexperts in statistical suicide studies have the same kinds of blinders when it comes to correlation and causation. so to be skeptical of their findings and conclusions on causation is warranted. \n\n\n", "i just stupidly asked el goog for information on the suicide hotline. friends

(this is a rough estimate on daily 5 minute videos, or ~250 views on a weekly 20 minute video). i understand youtube has a very steep curve for growth but you still have general social media to promote content (though watch out on direct linking outside twitter, that seems to slow down trending) and web sites. if one video catches a little traction on twitter or facebook & a web page posts it as a highly that traffic should push them into the world of being able to run ads. i think youtube will still calculate these channels into their predictive algorithm on what would be recommended to you based on previous viewing habits etc, just not suggested into their trending or main page. ya, a little rough, but every  successful youtube channel i\u2019ve seen has always talked about growth from a wide spread approach, never via youtube it\u2019s self. they\u2019ve always been featured on some neiche web sites at the start, or been huge on another app first, or had a large twitter following, or been a duo first and then broke out, etc. i see this as more of a side affect of human eyes having to approve channels instead of \u201clocking out\u201d new people. this cuts down all those channels that post one ten minute blog once every other month for 400 subscribers, or 20 second videos posted every day. youtube is trying to grow up into something to replace traditional media. they\u2019re certainly making enough mistakes on the way, but at the same time, they\u2019ve got to groom their content some as well to fit the image. ultimately if they can attract more ad money then creators that work hard (have small staffs, produce fairly videos, produce scripted videos, etc) will generate more revenue and be able to work a little less hard and not burn out. if you want to keep quality content you need to have the money there. they\u2019re not banning someone from posting a five minute vlog bitching about their bad day at high school or something every now and then, they\u2019re just saying \u201chey, maybe you\u2019re not really commercial level content yet...\u201d", "okay, since they\u2019re not gonna pay me $2 a month for including ads on my demonstration or instruction hobby videos because i\u2019m a \u201cnobody\u201d not worth wasting effort on. why not pay us \u201cnobodies\u201d for vetting their other videos that a clearly designed to game their automated algorithms hitting the top search results for the most ad revenue.", "right, so advertisers, who are google/youtube\u2019s main audience, said \u2018fix yo shit or we out\u2019. google/youtube had to admit that their algorithm wasn\u2019t up to the task of auto-vetting videos, so they have to do it with human beings. that will cost a lot of money, so they performed triage. only the channels that make more than their monitoring will cost will get ad revenue. if the channel doesn\u2019t generate enough money for google to balance the cost of ensuring it\u2019s safe for advertisers, they\u2019re not bothering.", "whenever people talk about alternatives to youtube, i always think \u201cvimeo\u201d.  i surf with ad blocking on so i have no idea if vimeo or dailymotion are trying to feed me ads.  do they not have monetization infrastructure for uploaders which is why they are not part of this conversation?", "i\u2019m surprised there hasn\u2019t been a big youtube alternative. now would be the perfect time to capitalize on youtube\u2019s failings. i\u2019ve tinkered around with ads on yt on my personal channel that i\u2019ve used for game play-throughs, podcasts and music, but this new development really discourages me from continuing.
