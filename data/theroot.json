kids are taught in kindergarten: \u201cwhile sticks and stones may break my bones, names will never harm me. malcolm made it clear nearly 50 yrs ago that black folks need to be careful of the negros and if i had my way, all of them would be on an ark back to europe. negros voted for the worm in the wh because they are all good house niggers and trying hard to be accepted by their fake ass white liberal colleagues and friends. when did we get so thin skinned. we fought against the kkk and white thugs and against what happened in oklahoma; negros talk a good fight but won\u2019t bust a grape with concrete booties on. the only colored folks in the admin are carson, and the wedding planner, the other sycophant was kicked out when she began believing her own press clippings. black is a state of mind not one of being; black is about standing up for the black diaspora by exerting the energy required to effectuate real changes in the community; in fact, they don\u2019t even live in the community,. getting as far away from the community to live among white folks why would anyone black believe that after 400 yrs of hating us and trying to kill us off that anything would change, particularly since it is passed from generation to generation. i don\u2019t care what anyone calls me, just don\u2019t call me collect. rednecks calling black folks \u201cracist\u201d is just another tool to piss negros to provide knee jerk denials, like they were really needed. i\u2019m not racist, i simply follow the nat turner school of jurisprudence, that which white folks understand and fear all to well. perhaps i will advertise for members to join the nat turner brigade for political change, and then have some fun with the fbi trying to find out all about it and listing it as terrorism. keep the clowns busy. i intentionally go where i know the red neck nation lives on aol to dog them, their families and anything else, and all with facts and evidence. the response that really pisses them off is the simple project taunt: \u201cyour mother is a pig.\u201d and then leave it at that with no response to their comeback. black folks, stop being thin skinned and bent about anything stupid white people say [not all white folks, just the really stupid ones] whatever they say is meant to piss you off and have y\u2019all foaming at the mouth; if you suspect something is from a troll, don\u2019t respond, just let it go. don l. lee wrote a poem back in the 60s when nikki and sonia and other black poets were doing their think, titled: \u201cwe are a funny tribe.\u201d google it and pay attention to what is being said. nothing they have to say means anything unless we give it meaning by engaging them; proverbs informs one about the the impact of arguing with fools, and jay z sang: \u201cdon\u2019t argue with a fool cuz people from a distance can\u2019t tell who is who. it is an aptly named \u201cfools errand\u201d to engage a fool. fi-amun allah\n"]}, {"date": "2018-01-17T09:00:00-05:00", "count": 1, "link": "https://www.theroot.com/in-the-race-for-georgia-governor-can-stacey-abrams-ush-1821982569", "comments": ["classified ad posting site"]}, {"date": "2018-01-16T19:00:00-05:00", "count": 1, "link": "https://www.theroot.com/dear-donald-trump-black-people-don-t-like-your-ass-1822131948", "comments": ["wait until summer. the midterm election ads will be ramping up then..."]}, {"date": "2018-01-11T08:28:00-05:00", "count": 3, "link": "https://www.theroot.com/idiot-teacher-asked-4th-graders-to-give-3-good-reasons-1821982084", "comments": ["i mean, i get how this question is offensive, but given that we here in america benefit from an economic system quite akin to slavery in order to have our plastic things that get sold on ad space on this site... nobodys hands are clean.", "now, in the first century ad it may have been preferable to be a bondservant versus just another peasant\u00a0starving in the middle of the desert; however that\u2019s a very different scenario than the slavery from the 18th and 19th centuries.", "this is astonishing to say the least. i am almost speechless. the school probably should be investigated by the justice department, but given who heads jd, that won\u2019t work. my kid would be outta there, or i would pop up so much they would think i teach there!"]}, {"date": "2018-01-11T08:01:00-05:00", "count": 1, "link": "https://www.theroot.com/man-attempts-to-kill-spider-with-fire-spider-sets-apar-1821981670", "comments": ["lol...saw that one earlier today and could\u2019ve sworn it was one of those random ads for magical new food that packs on pounds of muscle and always use photoshopped old dudes. he\u2019s even got that fake casual look on his face that says \u201cwho, me?
