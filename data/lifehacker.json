department, when i noticed that every price sign was roughly 10% higher than it should be; for example a $499 tv was priced $549. it turns out they were doing exactly this. the way the commissions worked at wards, you got a certain percentage of the current selling price of each item (the \u201cgo price\u201d). for a tv that was probably 3%, so $15. but the commission was 15% on every dollar above the go price. so if you managed to sell that tv for $549, your commission jumps from $15 to $22.50. or better yet, give them $50 off the extended warranty, which pays a 20% commission, but ring the extended warranty up at full price (maybe $80 or so) and take the discount off the price of the tv. now you\u2019re getting $15 on the tv, and $16 on the warranty, so you\u2019ve doubled your earnings and helped your warranty quota (which will get you fired quicker than anything else). the great thing is, there\u2019s no downside - if a customer has been comparison shopping or looked at the ad and knows the tv should be $499, just pull the $549.99 price off and the $499 price is right there were you left it (blame it on last nights shift for not getting this weeks ad prices up before close, even though that tv is literally always on sale for $499). once the customer leaves you can throw the $549 sign back over the $499 sign so you\u2019re ready for the next customer.\n"]},
