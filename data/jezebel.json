", "i think part of the problem is the category of \u201ctrafficking\u201d is pretty confused in the public debate. when people hear that word they imagine young girls kidnapped while walking home from school, bound and gagged, and shipped across the country. that is not what trafficking in the sex trade looks like. more often it\u2019s runaways or people who might be doing sex work voluntarily anyway, but have fallen into abusive or exploitative labor conditions at the hands of pimps or boyfriends. so once you view trafficking crimes through the lens of a labor issue and not a kidnapping issue, you can see how fosta was not meant to help trafficking. consider that there is more human trafficking in manufacturing, agriculture, and domestic services than there is in sex work. if someone told you they were going to help trafficking victims in agriculture by banning advertisements for the purchase of vegetables, would you believe them? of course not. the way you help victims of coerced labor is by giving them the protection of labor laws and making sure they can go to the police without fear of repercussions. ", "for me, as someone who has worked in anti-trafficking programs for 11 years, this is a tough one. so many cases i have heard about and worked on involved victims who were advertised on backpage against their will. many of them minors whose traffickers were able to turn them out within hours using this website. i was actually very happy when backpage was shut down, but now idk how i feel because i really see where these women are coming from and also see that this perspective wasn\u2019t something this law took into account (which is true with a lot of new legislation). ", "i worked in the juvenile justice system in a major american city and we would sometimes be alerted by clients if they had friends (or they themselves) were being trafficked and were utilizing backpage. i will never forget the visceral feeling of horror and disgust i experienced when i saw one of my 13-year-old female clients being advertised on backpage. with that experience in mind, my initial reaction to this article was that shutting down backpage is a good thing and anyone who thinks something to the contrary is an idiot."]}, {"date": "2018-06-02T17:31:00-04:00", "count": 1, "link": "https://jezebel.com/moms-facebook-no-longer-popular-with-kids-these-days-1826510309", "comments": ["my 17 year-old son only got a facebook account at 15 to start his business because older folks use fb and have $$$. he will be the first to tell you kids use insta and snapchat and parents use fb, but he\u2019s no dummy and gets free advertising and referrals from fb. he paid for his 1st car before he even got his license and has steady work...all from a free fb account.

worked on this show. i posted here back in november about jeffery and mitch and their abusive behavior and how someone needs to do some digging on arrested development, especially the 2 netflix seasons(4,5), which were particularly difficult and harmful on both cast and crew, like really difficult and harmful, even for the limits or nonexistent limits of hollywood productions. it\u2019s hard for me to see the press on on this season of arrested and to know about how mitch in particular treats people behind the scenes or allows people to be treated, in the case of anyone who comes into contact with tambor. jeffery\u2019s first day on set he called the 1st ad a cunt, in front of mitch and no one batted an eye, except for a pa, who had absolutely no power in that situation. mitch hurwitz is a notoriously unhealthy crazy person and really pushes the limits of mental and emotional abuse, in particular how he treats people in the writers room and edit room. everyone knows how awful he is, like everyone including the people that run fox and netflix, but he gets away with it every time. i also know the production office pas filed a sexual harassment complaint with fox hr against another producer on season 5. i\u2019m not totally sure that producer was removed or not. at least jeffery tambor is now getting called out on his horrific behavior. i witnessed jeffery\u2019s meltdown on jessica, it was so profoundly unprofessional and mean. no one outside of an actor or powerful creative in hollywood would get to keep their job after an out burst like that.\u00a0 mitch has never been called out, even though everyone knows about it and no one is willing to do anything about curtailing it. however, i will say mitch\u2019s behavior is one of the reason the original show was canceled\u00a0 by the network arm of fox, it wasn\u2019t just the ratings, but they used the ratings to still cover for a bunch other reasons. and mitch was completely off the rails for season 4, but fox studios let he come back for another one. i can tell you the show hasn\u2019t been good since season 2 and even those first two season were good in spite of it\u2019s creator.
