joycons, flip out the kick stand and let the kids play. now, assuming they didn\u2019t do something stupid like eliminate the blutooth support while they were in there,  you are on the hook for another controller and have to hope they can share a smaller screen. or just buy two lites, for ad hoc wifi. i\u2019m not even a parent and i can see the issue there. with the exception of battery-life, this model\u2019s a downgrade in every conceivable way and at a $199 pricepoint, not much value given the regular switch is easy to find well under msrp. besides, if this was really \u201cfor kids,\u201d kinda weird you\u2019d lock them away from the labo ecosystem, which nintendo is hoping will be a long-term albeit slow-burning income stream. . . \n\nmy only concern is that they\u2019d be dumb enough to look at their data, then go to the other extreme and build the \u201cpro\u201d around the people who only play docked. basically, make a traditional home-console-esque

some hefty millions, but the industry trans-formative success of wow changed them forever. the checks written to titan and the elongated development of the other ips where signed by wow\u2019s insane cashflow - a cashflow that shrunk in half in just around 2 years when the subscriber base went from 12 million to 5.7... even if activision wasn\u2019t a part of the picture, something would need to change for sure at blizzard if the writing was on the wall that their cash cow was drying up. sc2 could no longer afford to be in development for another 3 years, they\u2019d need to release what they had and finish the rest later. d3 was treated as an online, ongoing revenue source like wow was. these reactions could be entirely fueled by blizzard\u2019s own woes - \u201coh shit! we have all these half-done, massive projects that\u2019re nowhere near seeing the light of day and revenue is down.\u201d they didn\u2019t need activision to come in and make changes because they\u2019d know they

but there are no real turtle-dragons for me to take my \u201cfantasies\u201d out on.\n\nthere are people\u2014real people\u2014who are trans in the world, and fiction has a nasty habit of informing the way people react to the world around them. see also: the war of the worlds (given the reaction to the initial radio play), 1984 (given everyone and their brother quoting it these days), fahrenheit 451, romeo and juliet (because far too many people interpret a tragedy as a romance), and so on ad libitum.\n\nno, fiction does not cause negative actions in the real world, but it can and does help to mold thinking\u2014in both the absence and presence of context. fiction consumed in the presence of real-world context tends to have an ameliorating effect on prejudice, whereas fiction consumed in the absence of context can often have the opposite effect.\n\none other thing: fiction does not exist in a vacuum. it is and always has been a reflection of the time period, social order, and general cultural mien that exists at the time of its creation. that reflection can often be distorted, sure, but it\u2019s still a reflection\u2014even when it\u2019s imperfect.\n\nif that imperfection has the capacity to have a negative impact on real people, it behooves the author to have a care about how they are presenting fictional characters that too often will be taken as representative of those real people.\n\nnext time you want to try a sophistry-laden argument concerning the nature of fiction on someone, try not doing it to a professor of literature; it\u2019s not the best strategy.\n"],

teams were setting up skirmishes.\n\nthey still popped into player perspectives fairly regularly, but it was more for highlights of impressive/cool plays that individual players had made. my mom was able to follow it better than i expected (her video game experience is minesweeper) after i explained \u201cthe big ones are tanks, they protect their team, most of the small ones are there to focus on killing other people, and a few of the small ones heal their teammates. when they are in first person, the little skull in the middle means they killed someone.\u201d\n\nthe main complaint i had is what squadaloo points out \u2014 they would often swap into a player-cam to show a cool sniper highlight or something and then by the time the highlight is over point control had changed or something. those big plays really open overwatch matches up and cause big changes to the playfield very quickly. i think they need to learn to just follow the action until each engagement ends, and then do a recap in the lull where teams reset to show highlights that made the big play happen (i.e. show us player cams on replay while teams are waiting on respawns and getting set up for an engagement).

the game in the future and never claimed historical accuracy (which battlefield has time and time again). it\u2019s because it caters more to those that just like senseless violence than those with a fascination with history. it\u2019s because it\u2019s blatent tokenism and pandering. even many women despise this move by the battlefield devs because it\u2019s tacky and hamfisted. they\u2019ve been nothing but disrespectful, pretentious, and simply rude to their upset fans since. i will say, i was much more upset by how absolute shit hardline was than this. i really don\u2019t care at this point
