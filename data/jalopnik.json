avoiding increasingly apocalyptic levels of global warming. i don\u2019t support them as a for-profit entity or a car company, but because somehow the us government still doesn\u2019t even acknowledge global warming on many levels and every other car company has literally zero incentive to make the switch, supporting tesla somehow feels like the best option for promoting this switch. i don\u2019t think elon musk is jesus, but somehow noone else can be bothered to give two shits about one of the largest (preventable) ad potentially existential problems which face humanity. i completely support every other auto maker who makes the switch, as well as any other entity (government, company, website, any collection of people really) who recognizes a switch away from fossil fuels is probably a

to pressure from the brand, and typically as the salesperson you\u2019ve got more of a leash to close a deal, whether it be negotiating on the trade or the sale price.\n\nultimately the sales person
